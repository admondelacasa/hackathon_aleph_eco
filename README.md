🔐 BuildTrust

A zero-commission Web3 platform bringing trust and fairness to contractors and clients through milestone-based smart contracts.
🚀 What is BuildTrust?

Independent contractors in construction and home services often face unreliable clients, payment delays, and high platform fees.

BuildTrust solves this by combining blockchain technology with real-world service contracting:

    ✅ Wallet-based signup
    ✅ Milestone contracts powered by Ethereum
    ✅ Escrow in USDC & stablecoins
    ✅ Trustless, automatic payments
    ✅ Zero commission — full payment goes to contractors
    ✅ Staking for extra yield on locked funds

⚡ Why It Matters

    For Contractors: Get paid fairly, on time, with no hidden fees.
    For Clients: Release payments only when milestones are met, ensuring project quality.
    For Everyone: Transparent, auditable smart contracts make disputes and middlemen obsolete.

🛠 Tech Stack

    Ethereum + Solidity – Smart contracts & milestone logic
    Web3 / Ethers.js – Wallet connection
    Stablecoins (USDC, etc.) – Secure, predictable payments
    React / Next.js – Frontend experience

🧪 Quick Example

    Client hires a carpenter via BuildTrust.
    Contract is created with three milestones.
    Client funds escrow in USDC.
    After each milestone, funds are released to the contractor automatically.
    Both parties complete the project with no commissions and full transparency.

⚡ BuildTrust = The Web3 bridge between blockchain technology and traditional service industries.
